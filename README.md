## Description

This project provides power of Qt to Java world, for both Qt itself
and for programs and libraries built with Qt.

## Features

* Qt 4.8 compliant bindings for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows
* “Stand-alone” generator for generating bindings for miscellaneous Qt programs and libraries

### Known problems

* We don’t at the moment have stable OSX maintainer, so OSX releases are lacking behind
* Qt 5 support is still WIP

## Requirements

Users:

* Java 1.5 or greater

For compiling your own packages:

* JDK
* Ant 1.8 (or greater)
* Qt 4.X, can be either self-built or distribution package, as long as it contains all development headers and modules you want and qmake
* make

Jambi basically has all the same dependencies Qt has, but many modules of Qt are in reality optional, so you could well for example
drop QtWebkit, if you don’t need it.

## Installation

Newest releases can be found at http://qtjambi.org/downloads.

If you wish to compile Jambi from sources, there is more information at [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

For a more detailed guide check our [Compiling Guides](http://redmine.smar.fi/projects/qtjambi/wiki/Compiling_Guides) 

## Contributing

### Gerrit

Preferably, we will take contributions to our [Gerrit](http://gerrit.smar.fi/#/q/project:qtjambi-community):

1. Register to [Gerrit](http://gerrit.smar.fi/#/q/project:qtjambi-community)

For convenience, our Gerrit uses Github as authentication. When you click the Sign in button (for registration),
it redirects to you Github for authorizing Gerrit to access some information in your profile. Afterwards,
you can populate your Gerrit profile from Github data by choosing the GitHub tab from menu, Profile from sub-menu
and you see your user information. After verifying they are correct, you can press the Import button and the information
will be added to your Gerrit profile.

2. Clone the git repository

You can use a clone from Github as well as use Gerrit as only source. If you decide to use Github as main remote,
you need to add gerrit as alternative remote: `git add remote gerrit ssh://[YOURUSER]@gerrit.smar.fi:29418/qtjambi-community`

3. Do your modifications

touch nya
git add nya
git commit nya -m "My new shiny commit"

4. git push gerrit HEAD:refs/for/master

More information about how Gerrit works can be found at their [official documentation](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.11/intro-quick.html).

### Github

Alternatively, you can do pull requests at Github using the standard pattern :-)

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (git checkout -b my-new-feature)
3. Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add some feature')
4. Push to the branch (git push origin my-new-feature)
5. Create new Pull Request
