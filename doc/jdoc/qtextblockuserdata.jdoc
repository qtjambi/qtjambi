<class name="QTextBlockUserData" doc="/**
<p>The QTextBlockUserData class is used to associate custom data with blocks of text.</p>
<p>QTextBlockUserData provides an abstract interface for container classes that are used to associate application-specific user data with text blocks in a QTextDocument.</p>
<p>Generally, subclasses of this class provide functions to allow data to be stored and retrieved, and instances are attached to blocks of text using QTextBlock::setUserData(). This makes it possible to store additional data per text block in a way that can be retrieved safely by the application.</p>
<p>Each subclass should provide a reimplementation of the destructor to ensure that any private data is automatically cleaned up when user data objects are deleted.</p>
